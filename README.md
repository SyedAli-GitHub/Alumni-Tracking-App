# My Project Name
University Alumni Tracking App

## Project description
The project is to create a GUI based Application which would store alumni information through user input function. 
The information would be as followed: Name, ID No, Passing Year, Department's name, Current Town, Current Country, 
Work status- Business/ Service/ Selfemployed, Current company or institution name, contact number, email address etc.

Exactly what your project will do -- try to describe it from the user's perspective.
The project will craete an application for using in desktop and mobile device. 
When the application will be in operation, it  will be prompted to store some specific 
data (Name, ID No, Passing Year, Department's name, Current Town, Current Country, 
Work status- Business/ Service/ Selfemployed, Current company or institution name, 
contact number, email address etc) through individual user (Alumni) input. 
Registered user will be able to enter information, edit/update when required, delete and re-enter again.
Ultimate goal of this app will be to track the individual alumni's updated information from anywhere in the world, 
for example if any alumni visits a new place in a new country and need some assistance/information (i,e: travelling, 
medical, accomodation, education, training, job etc) he/she can track through the app if there is any 
fellow alumni living or working nearby or in that area. 
If he or she find some one then he/she can approach easily and get necessary helps. 

## Goals for Version 1
Version 1 will be to Create primary version application where there will be a mini database of few of my well known alumni, then to create the GUI.

What is "in scope" for Version 1.0 -- what's the simplest possible version of your project?
Scopes are as follows:
 -Creating Database
 -Creating GUI
 -Developing the Application
 -Testing the Application
 -Launching the application in mobile and desktop platform.

## Libraries / Other Technology Needed

Which Python libraries will you use? Do they have good documentation / tutorials?
Mainly Kivy and MySQL will be used. They have extensive documentation and tutorials online. 

## Risks

What are the risks -- things that would stop your project from getting completed? For each risk, think about how you could mitigate it.
Risk 1 - Creating database in MySQL will be firs challenge as I do not have prior knowledge or experience in MySQL. 
   Mitigation- I have already started learning MySQL online through online video and documentation.
Risk 2 - As I am on Python learing curve, it will be some challenging to get everything out of it.
   Mitigation - I will try to solve this issue through documentation and peer programmers.
Risk 3 - Kivy is completely new to me.
   Mitigation - I will get help from online materials.
